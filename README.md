Problem Statement

Business Context

Workplace safety in hazardous environments like construction sites and industrial plants is crucial to prevent accidents and injuries. One of the most important safety measures is ensuring workers wear safety helmets, which protect against head injuries from falling objects and machinery. Non-compliance with helmet regulations increases the risk of serious injuries or fatalities, making effective monitoring essential, especially in large-scale operations where manual oversight is prone to errors and inefficiency.

To overcome these challenges, SafeGuard Corp plans to develop an automated image analysis system capable of detecting whether workers are wearing safety helmets. This system will improve safety enforcement, ensuring compliance and reducing the risk of head injuries. By automating helmet monitoring, SafeGuard aims to enhance efficiency, scalability, and accuracy, ultimately fostering a safer work environment while minimizing human error in safety oversight.

Objective

As a data scientist at SafeGuard Corp, you are tasked with developing an image classification model that classifies images into one of two categories:

With Helmet: Workers wearing safety helmets.
Without Helmet: Workers not wearing safety helmets.
